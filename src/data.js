Users must login with valid credentials, and are able to borrow, return, renew, and search for books within the library database. Teacher logins are able to remove books from the library, and request new books to be added to the database. This project stretched the limit of what our group could implement given our tools. However by using complex data structures, verification programs, loop based flows, and object oriented programming, we implemented all required functions of the project assignment.",
